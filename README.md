This fork is a unique modified version of KP Liberation, and many of its elements are based on several PRs that have already been sent.

This started as a fix for fatal bugs and elements that needed to be improved in KP Lib that had not been released since v0.96.7a. In other words, the internal version is v0.96.7a+ (Currently, 0.96.8a+++). This is a compilation of elements from 0.96.8 that were frozen in the middle of development and PRs that were not merged.

It may look inferior to Liberation RX and other Liberations, but this fork is mainly an improvement of KP Lib, and I did not want to change the gameplay too much.

I also checked several other forks and included some simple and effective improvements. This fork is intended to function as a base plate for modifications, so there should not have been any major modifications.

All licenses and rights of this fork comply with the original KP Lib.

I personally recommend https://github.com/moistbois/Moist-Liberation-APR, which includes more extensive elements in addition to this fork.
