### Presets
The included presets are outdated, so we recommend using customizations and creating your own. This fork serves as a base for customizing missions.

### About This Fork
This project started as a fix for critical bugs and improvements needed in KP Liberation that had not been released since version 0.96.7a. Essentially, the internal version is v0.96.7a+ (currently, 0.96.8a+++). It is a compilation of elements from 0.96.8 that were in development and PRs that were not merged.

While it may seem less advanced compared to Liberation RX and other variants, this fork primarily aims to improve KP Liberation without significantly altering the gameplay. After reviewing several other forks, some simple yet effective improvements have been included. This fork is designed to be a foundation for further modifications, ensuring no major changes are present.

All licenses and rights of this fork comply with the original KP Liberation.

### Recommended anothor Fork
I personally recommend [Moist-Liberation-APR](https://github.com/moistbois/Moist-Liberation-APR), which includes more extensive elements in addition to this fork.
